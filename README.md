# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to review a dataset of Amazon reviews and determine if there is any bias in the Vine reviews that were paid versus unpaid. I chose to analyze a set of Video Game reviews.

## Results
There were 94 total Vine reviews and 40,471 total non-Vine reviews. 

Of the Vine reviews, 48 were five-stars. Of the non-Vine reviews, 15,663 were five-stars. 

This means that 51% of the Vine reviews were five stars and 39% of the non-Vine reviews are five-stars. 

## Summary
Determining if there is a positivity bias for this dataset is complicated, because there is a drastic difference in the amount of Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews. With that said, it's possible there could be a positivity bias, given that the majority of Vine reviews are five stars and less than half of the non-vine reviews are five-stars. However, the difference in percentage for each is only 12% which is not very large. The best thing to do to answer this question would be to collect more Vine review samples. As for working with the data as is, it might help to determine the average review rating for Vine vs non-Vine reviews and compare those two numbers.
